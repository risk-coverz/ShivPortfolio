            <p>On November 16, 2024, I had the privilege of serving as a mentor at FuturENG, an outreach initiative hosted by the Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science (FEAS) at Toronto Metropolitan University, supported by Hydro-One through the WEMADEIT program. This event was designed to engage and inspire female high school students (Grades 9–12) through immersive, hands-on workshops centered around electric vehicle design and prototyping using materials developed in our university’s advanced engineering labs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a mentor, I actively guided students through the design and manufacturing challenges they encountered, encouraging creative problem-solving and offering insight into real-world engineering workflows. I took the initiative to connect with students on a personal level—learning about their prior STEM experiences and helping them translate curiosity into tangible engineering solutions. Whether supporting beginners or more experienced learners, my role was to foster confidence and spark lasting interest in engineering disciplines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This experience deepened my passion for STEM outreach and highlighted the impact of mentorship in promoting diversity and inclusion within engineering. Seeing young students collaborate, innovate, and grow in a single day was truly inspiring, and I’m grateful to have contributed to an event that empowers the next generation of engineers.</p>

            </div>

            <p>During the Toronto Metropolitan University Open House, I had the opportunity to serve as a student ambassador and engineering representative, engaging with prospective students and their families to provide insight into the Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science (FEAS). I guided attendees through academic programs, lab facilities, and student project showcases, offering first-hand perspectives on university life, course experiences, and extracurricular opportunities within aerospace and mechanical engineering.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My role also involved answering technical questions, sharing my project experiences, and demystifying the transition from high school to university-level STEM education. This experience sharpened my communication skills, strengthened my ability to represent complex academic programs clearly, and deepened my passion for fostering student engagement in the engineering community.</p>
